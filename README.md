Rashock_AutoMail

An addon for World of Warcraft 1.12 that automatically sends items to your bank characters based on customizable rules.
Originally developed for Turtle-WoW.

🚧 Status

⚠️ Testing Phase
At the moment, items are only sent to hardcoded bank characters (currently mine).
If you try it out, don’t worry if your items end up in my mailbox. 😉

✨ Features (planned & in development)

Rule-based automatic mailing system

Define which items go to which bank character

Simple and lightweight – designed for WoW 1.12 client

Compatible with Turtle-WoW

Future: Configurable bank characters instead of hardcoded ones

📦 Installation

Download the addon files.

Extract them into your WoW AddOns folder:

Enable Rashock_AutoMail in the AddOn list on the character selection screen.

🎮 Usage

Currently, the addon is still in testing:
